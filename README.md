The Personal Fitness Tracker is a Python-based application that allows users to log calorie intake, track workouts, and monitor fitness progress in an offline environment. It uses SQLite/CSV for data storage, Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization, and provides a simple user interface (CLI/Tkinter) for easy interaction. This project is designed to be cost-effective, user-friendly, and customizable, making fitness tracking accessible without the need for expensive subscriptions or internet connectivity. Future enhancements may include AI-driven fitness recommendations, wearable device integration, and cloud-based data syncing.
